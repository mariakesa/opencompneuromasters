    "Just as probability theory deals with quantifying uncertainty, differential equations are in the business of quantifying change. Does a variable increase, decrease, oscillate or stand still in time? In order to quantify the change of a variable in time, we need to look at how it behaves over a time interval. This is akin to measuring the velocity of a bicycle by dividing the distance that it travelled by the time it took to get there, as in the following formula.\n",

    "$$v=\\frac{s}{t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v$ is the speed, $t$ is time and $s$ is the distance travelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we may be interested in how fast the bicycle is going at a point in time, not an interval, just as if the bicycle had a speedometer. This is where calculus comes in. Calculus takes a leap of faith and defines so called infinitesimal quantities that are defined by letting a quantity go to zero in a limiting process. This allows us to define the derivative ofa  function that quantifies how fast a variable is changing at a particular point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\lim_{t\\to\\0} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $dx$ is an infinitesimal change in the variable $x$ and $dt$ is an infinitesimal change in time. Let's say $x$ is akin to the distance that the bicycle has travelled. We can see how the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$ behave by steadily decreasing $\\Delta t$. We can set $\\Delta t= 0.1, 0.01, 0.001,0.0001, 0.0001, ...$ and checking the corresponding $\\Delta x$ e.g. the amount by which $x$ has changed during a smaller and smaller time interval. As we do so, and divide $\\Delta x$ by $\\Delta t$ we get a better and better approximation to the instantaneous velocity. \n",

    "Eventually, this velocity converges to a value which is its derivative or its instantaneous velocity. To generalize from the example of the bicycle, what the derivative really is is the instantaneous rate of change of a quantity. We are interested in using the derivative for modeling neurons, for example we may be interested in how the voltage across the membrane of a model neuron changes in time."
