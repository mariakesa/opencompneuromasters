    "The neuron can be thought of as an electrical circuit. It has ion fluxes through protein doorways that are called ion channels that are sensitive to voltage across the cell membrane. Ionic fluxes through ion channels in the cell membrane have dynamics that can be described by physics and mathematical models. Using concepts from electrical physics we can study how brief pulses of depolarization (the change of the relative voltage between the inside and outside of the cell) called action potentials are generated. Action potentials serve as physical substrates of information exchange between neurons as they form intricate communication and information processing networks. \n",

    "We begin studying the electrical properties of neurons with simplified models that serve as stepping stones to understanding the electro-chemical dynamics of information processing in the brain. In particular we study how membrane capacitance and resistance allow neurons to integrate and filter synaptic currents over time. "

    "The membrane of a cell is what defines its identity in relation to its surroundings. It is an extremely thin sheet (5-10 nm, 1000 x thinner than the human hair) of polarized phospholipids. A phospholipid molecule consists of a charged phosphite molecule and a long electrically neutral hydrocarbon chain. When placed in water, phospholipids self-organize into a bilayer, meaning that the charged hydrophilic phosphite molecules interface with water while the hydrophobic electrically neutral hydrocarbon chains hide themselves from the water medium. It's like a molecular sandwich with the phosphites forming the bun and the hydrocarbon chains forming the veggie patty. \n",

    "The cell membrane insulates the inside from the outside and its hydrophobic part prevents the movement of ions across it. However, life would be boring if the cell was merely a blob that could not exchange matter information with its environment. That's why cells evolved membrane spanning proteins called ion channels. They are like doors, some of them with key holes (meaning that they only open when a specific molecule binds to it), others opening in response to the change the difference in positive and negative ion concentration between the inside and outside of the cell (charge difference or voltage) and still others that are always open. These ion channels allow specific ions to pass through the membrane and thus enable intra-membrane ion fluxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In nerve cells, the concentration of ions is different in the inside and outside of the cell. The water in which the cell is embedded and is filled with acts as a polar solvent that dissolves small inorganic molecules. The water is a medium or a \"wire\" that conducts the various ionic flows that act as a substrate for biological information processing. Sodium, chloride (a good way to remember that is that Na and Cl are basically dissociated salt molecules, therefore the neuron is essentially embedded in salt water exactly as it evolved from single cells in the primodial ocean, there are about $6\n",
    "\\cdot 10^{19}$ salt molecules dissolved in a cubic centimeter of an extracellular solution) and calcium ions are more abundant outside of the cell membrane and potassium ions are more abundant inside. Also, there is a difference in charge concetration between the inside and the outside of the membrane which gives rise to a voltage difference. This voltage difference is essential for neural signaling and one of the bases of action potentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The so called power supplies of the membrane, i.e. the molecular elements that maintain a voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell, are the membrane-spanning ion pumps. They use energy to export three sodium ions  and import two potassium ions in one cycle of operation. They need ATP (energy) for that because sodium is more abundant outside of the cell and potassium is more abundant inside the cell, they are thus working against the concentration gradient. \n",

    "Currents flow through the cell membrane due to two driving forces: diffusion and electrostatic forces (drift of charged particles in an electric field). Because there is an uneven concentration of different ions inside and outside the cell membrane, these concentration gradients act as one of the driving forces for intracellular ionic currents and when ion channels for a particular ion open in the membrane, those particular ions will flow down their concentration gradient. This is because they \"want\" to achieve an equilibrium in their distribution, i.e. they will tend to redistribute themselves so that their distribution is even meaning that they will flow in a direction where there is less of them. Diffusion depends on the temperature of the system. Diffusion is behind the redistribution of dye when you drop a few drops into a water container. \n",

    "During diffusion particles move and collide with each other and thus trace out random trajectories called a random walk. For example, a sodium ion in a physiological solution will collide with another molecule $10^{13}$ times per second. Diffusion is fast at short length scales. To diffuse across a cell body (10 micrometers) takes 50 milliseconds. Diffusion is slow at large length scales. To diffuse down a dendrite (1 millimeter) takes 10 minutes. To diffuse from the cell body down the motor neuron axon (1 m) it takes 10 years. "
