    "The membrane of a cell is what defines its identity in relation to it's surroundings. It is an extremely thin sheet (8-10 nm, 1000 x thinner than the human hair) of polarized phospholipids. A phospholipid molecule consists of a charged phosphite molecule and a long electrically neutral hydrocarbon chain. When placed in water, phospholipids self-organize into a bilayer, meaning that the charged hydrophilic phosphite molecules interface with water while the hydrophobic electrically neutral hydrocarbon chains hide themselves from the water medium. It's like a molecular sandwhich with the phosphites forming the bun and the hydrocarbon chains forming the meat. \n",

    "The cell membrane is an insulates the inside from the outside and its hydrophobic part prevents the movement of ions across it. However life would be boring if the cell was merely a blob that could not exchange matter information with its environment. That's why cells evolved membrane spanning proteins called ion channels. They are like doors, some of them with key holes (meaning that they only open when a specific molecule binds to it), others opening in response to the change the difference in positive and negative ion concentration between the inside and outside of the cell (charge difference or voltage) and still others that are always open. These ion channels allow specific ions to pass through the membrane and thus enable intramembrane ion fluxes.\n",
